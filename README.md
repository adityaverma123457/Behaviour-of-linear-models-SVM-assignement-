# Behaviour-of-linear-models-SVM-assignement-
Understanding behaviour of linear models in different use cases and condition such as outlier effect on decision point , class imbalance,etc
In total there are 5 notebooks in this whole task:
1)What if Data is imabalanced in linear regression and linear svm , 2) behaviour of linear model in case of difference in varience between different features 
3) Behaviour of outliers on Linear regression 4) Behaviour of linear model in case of feature collinearity 5) Implementing Decision Function of SVM RBF Kernel and platt's scaling
